# Facebook Authentication plugin for Joomla

This Git repository hosts the Facebook Authentication plugin for Joomla! 3.7 and later.

## Documentation

We have extensive documentation available in the [documentation wiki](https://github.com/joomla-extensions/facebook-auth/wiki).

## Support  

Please do not ask for generic support i.e. how to use this plugin, Joomla! or Facebook through direct messages to the developers or issues on the GitHub tracker. Due to the limited time of our volunteers these may receive no reply in a reasonable amount of time or at all. You can ask for support in the [official Joomla! forum](http://forum.joomla.org) or a local Joomla forum in your country / region. Joomla forums are active with thousands of people every day making it all the more likely that you'll get a fast reply.

## Collaboration

Bug reports and feature requests are very welcome but please do check if the same request has been made before. Duplicate issues will typically be closed as such. If you are a developer we encourage you to submit a Pull Request with the code pertaining to your bug fix or feature request.

## Translations

Translations are managed through the [Joomla! Official Extensions project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/joomla-patchtester). We currently do not have any instructions for installing additional languages of this plugin.

## Credits

The Facebook Plugin core-supported project was conceived and currently maintained by [Nicholas K. Dionysopoulos](https://www.dionysopoulos.me).
